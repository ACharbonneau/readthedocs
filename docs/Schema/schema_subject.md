title: Subject schema
---

The **Subject** entity is the outer most record in the Subjects endpoint. Within the **Subject** record are the fields for the **Subject** (demographic and other subject-specific information), a Files field which lists the id of all files associated with the **Subject**, as well as the record of all **ResearchSubject** records associated with that **Subject**. Each **ResearchSubject** record has fields associated with the **ResearchSubject**, as well as records for the **Diagnosis** and **Specimen** entities associated with that **ResearchSubject**, and so on.

Use the "+" and "-" icons to expand and collapse sections of the schema.
